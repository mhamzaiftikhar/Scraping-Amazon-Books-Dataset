# Web Scraping Amazon Bestsellers Books

## Overview
This Python project demonstrates web scraping techniques to extract data from Amazon's bestsellers books section. Using libraries like BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML and requests for making HTTP requests, the script navigates through multiple pages of book listings, extracting details such as titles, authors, ratings, reviews, and prices.

## Features
- **Pagination Handling:** Iterates through multiple pages using dynamic URLs to scrape comprehensive data.
- **Data Extraction:** Extracts structured information from each book listing, including nested elements like ratings and reviews.
- **Data Processing:** Converts scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame for easy analysis and manipulation.
- **CSV Output:** Saves the extracted data into a CSV file (`AmazonBooks.csv`) for further use.

## Setup
To run the script:
1. Install Python (if not already installed): [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   
2. Install required libraries:
-- pip install requests
-- pip install bs4
-- pip install pandas

3. Run the script:
-- python app.py
   
# Usage
- Modify `scrape_amazon_books.py` to customize data extraction or handling.
- Explore and analyze the generated CSV file (`AmazonBooks.csv`) using tools like Excel or Python data analysis libraries.
